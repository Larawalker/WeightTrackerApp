# WeightTrackerApp
The app I developed was a weight-tracking application designed to help users log their daily weight, set a goal weight, and track progress over time. The main user need it addressed was providing an easy and organized way to record health data while receiving feedback when they reached their goals.
To support these needs, the app included a login screen, a data grid screen to display all weight entries, and forms to add new weights and set a goal weight. Notifications were also included to alert users when they reached their goal. My UI design kept users in mind by making the screens clean, consistent, and simple to navigate, ensuring the most important actions—logging weight and checking progress—were always accessible.
When coding the app, I used a step-by-step approach: building one feature at a time, testing it, and fixing errors before moving forward. I applied modular design and consistent naming conventions to keep the code organized. These techniques not only helped me debug quickly but are strategies I can use in future projects to maintain efficiency and clarity.
I tested the app through the Android Emulator, verifying that each screen loaded correctly, database entries were saved and retrieved, and notifications triggered under the right conditions. Testing was important because it revealed small logic errors and UI alignment issues that could have negatively affected the user experience if left unresolved.
Throughout the process, one challenge I had to innovate around was connecting the database smoothly with the UI. By breaking down the problem and testing different query methods, I was able to ensure that data flowed correctly between the two.
One area where I was particularly successful was in implementing the RecyclerView to display user weight entries. This feature demonstrated my ability to combine UI components with functional database operations, showing both my coding skills and my understanding of user-centered design.
